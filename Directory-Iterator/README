Directory-Iterator version 1.000
===============================

This is a simple, efficient way to get a recursive list of all files under a
specified directory.

It implements a typical iterator interface, making it simple to convert code
that processes a list of files to use this instead.  The directory is read
as the list is consumed, so memory overhead is minimal.

This module simply loads the appropriate backend; either
Directory::Iterator::PP or Directory::Iterator::XS.  With the
pure-perl backend, the speed is equivalent to File::Find; the XS backend
is a few times faster.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Directory::Iterator::PP - The pure-perl backend

  If available, the recommended Directory::Iterator::XS will be used instead
  as it is a few times faster.
