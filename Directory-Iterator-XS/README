Directory-Iterator-XS version 1.000
==================================

This is a simple, efficient way to get a recursive list of all files under a
specified directory.

It implements a typical iterator interface, making it simple to convert code
that processes a list of files to use this instead.  The directory is read
as the list is consumed, so memory overhead is minimal.

This module implements the XS (C++) backend, which is a few times faster
than the pure-perl equivalant.
